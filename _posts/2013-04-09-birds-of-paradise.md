title: Birds of Paradise
---

As I'm sure (none of) you know, I'm constantly on the lookout for nice, clean 
themes for my text editors. There are a few I've used in the past that are 
very nice - [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) to name one - but 
I always find they have the same issue: they look ugly when editing html and 
(s)css.

Today, however, I found one that is excellent for just that. It's called Birds 
of Paradise:

<figure>
  <img src="/static/img/birds-one.png" alt="Birds of Paradise theme sample" />
  <figcaption>
    Birds of Paradise and Sass.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/static/img/birds-two.png" alt="Another Birds of Paradise sample" />
  <figcaption>
    Very meta.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Its design isn't exclusive to html or css (it supports everything from Ruby to 
ActionScript), and comes from a 
[long](http://joebergantine.com/projects/color-schemes/specials-board/) 
[line](http://railscasts.com/about) of [other](http://idlefingers.co.uk/) 
themes, but it is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for.

You can download it [here](http://joebergantine.com/projects/color-schemes/birds
-of-paradise/). The font used in the above screenshots is 
[Ubuntu Mono](http://font.ubuntu.com/).
