After months of deliberation and procrastination I've **finally** added some content onto this site! I'll be using it as a place to show the design and photography projects I've been working on, as well as blog posts when I get around to them.

If you're reading this around the time of publishing I'm sure you'll have noticed that it looks a little sparse - but I'm working on it. I'm in the process of sorting images to add to the portfolio, and I have a few posts lined up - *in my brain* - for the blog, so hopefully it shouldn't be too long before there are more things to see.

As for the site itself, I'm still tinkering with the layout and design so don't be surprised if things end up looking very different. I need to have a contact section, for one, but in the meantime if you have any questions or queries, feel free get it touch with me at <a href="mailto:alan@alanlongstaff.com" title="Contact Me">alan@alanlongstaff.com</a>, or [@alanlongstaff](https://twitter.com/alanlongstaff) on Twitter.
