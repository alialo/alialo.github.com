title: Itsy Theme

Although I like the default [Itsy](http://www.mowglii.com/itsy/) theme I don't find it clean enough for my desktop - so I've decided to create my own:

Themes are made using only css (excluding icons, although I'd be interested in trying [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) with it) so you can get something usable extremely quickly.

Mowglii has a [good guide](http://www.mowglii.com/itsy/themes/howto.html) on creating your own, as well as a sample theme to get you started. If you're no good at creating icons I highly recommend looking at [Yusuke Kamiyamane's](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) brilliant sets.

I'll post my theme file here once completed.
