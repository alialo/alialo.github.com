Although this blog section would suggest otherwise I am still alive and kicking - I just appear to have forgotten how to type.

I'm currently working on a few different projects (one of which has been ongoing for many months now) hence the lack of updates, but I've set aside some time to get things back on track. So what have I been doing? Gaining knowledge and designing for the web, mainly.

I've stumbled across a number of different resources that have helped significantly over the past year or so, and it would only be right to share. So:

[Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/) is fantastic. I urge you to read the documentation, but in summary - it's the UI Jekyll never had. HTML includes, smart paths, Sass compilation and the ability to share your work in progress with clients (plus much more). There's a 14 day trial available or you can pay &pound;16.99 for the [full version](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hammer/id548600167?mt=12).

[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/). Bourbon is an extremely useful mixin library for Sass. Special mention to the [triangle mixin](http://bourbon.io/docs/#triangle), the results of which you can see in the above image. As for Bourbon Neat:

<blockquote><p>Neat is an open source semantic grid framework built on top of Sass and Bourbon.</p></blockquote>

I've tried any number of frameworks previously but Neat is the one I've enjoyed the most. It works via mixins in your Sass rather than extra presentational classes or divs in your markup - if you've used [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) or similar it'll take a little getting used to, but the results are fantastic. Its grid overlay is the icing on the cake.

[Perch](http://grabaperch.com/). The best CMS I've ever used - and I only started using it over the past week. Rather than throwing everything and the kitchen sink at your users, Perch lets you define small regions (or large regions; it's all up to you) as editable areas in which content types of your specification can be placed. A [demo](http://grabaperch.com/demo) is available and you're encouraged to try it again after it expires (how thoughtful) - but I suggest you grab a copy of the full version. It's great.

And finally... [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/). I don't think I need to go into detail. If you've ever used Bootstrap I'm sure you've heard of it, but Font Awesome is... well, you fill in the rest.

More updates soon!
